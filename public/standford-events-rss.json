This talk examines why major changes in strategy have been pursued at these periods and not at other times, highlighting the role of shifts in the conduct of warfare in the international system and unity among the top leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.",

Noah Bullock will give an overview of the state of human rights in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras through the lens of the politics of each country and of the United States. Despite great challenges and backward-trending developments such as the dismissal of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) in Guatemala and the Trump Administration’s Northern Triangle policy aimed at burnishing its anti-immigration bona fides for a domestic audience, there is an undying flame of hope in all three Northern Triangle countries and promising signs for a more peaceful future.",

Says Bullock, “Human rights were taught to me as a historical process, and every generation has to be able to understand human rights and violations in their own time. Our moment has changed significantly from when these frameworks were established, so we are challenged now to find ways to apply these same principles in programming to address our moment’s greatest challenges of displacement by violence, poverty, and inequality.”",

Yet the presumed symbiosis between the simplicity of just letting go into intrinsic awakened cognition and the elaboration of standard tantric practices stands at the end of historical processes which have often given voice to tensions between these two currents of Buddhist thought and practice. This presentation will explore these points of friction through analysis of a revelatory cycle rediscovered by the famous Treasure revealer Sangyé Lingpa (1340–1396) called",

This cycle brings together the Great Perfection contemplative practices of recognizing intrinsic non-dual awareness and enabling spontaneous visionary experiences, with the standard tantric practices of detailed visualization, ritual practice, and material religion, prescribing the manufacture of the cycle’s basic text into circular diagrams and their distribution as amulets. This combination of features—at once discursive and material, contemplative and ritual—can, it will be argued, throw into particularly sharp relief the deeper tensions—both problematic and productive—between the opposing tendencies toward simplicity or elaboration in Buddhist traditions as a whole."

                  "The second part of the three-part documentary series “Music, War and Revolution” is dedicated to Russian composers of the late teens and early ’20s of the last century. The former “young wild ones,” composers such as Arthur Lourié, Nikolai Roslawets, Alexander Mosolov as well as Vladimir Deshevov and Lev Termen remain to this day relatively and unjustly unknown and their lives have remained largely unexplored. However, this generation injected life into the musical world of that time, greatly leaving their mark. The young composers were adventuresome; they flirted with futurism, wrote the first twelve-tone chord of musical history, invented the first electronic musical instrument and created sounds previously unheard.",
                  "Rediscovering these composers who were banned, partly forgotten and erased from the musical landscape – as well as providing room for their absolutely enchanting music that is unjustly only rarely heard – gives this documentary its purpose. By tracing their personal and artistic vitae, the political and cultural climate and the reality of life in Russia in the early 20th century, the documentary aims to bring these composers to life once again and to reveal the links between art, society and politics. In addition, musicologists, composers, musicians and descendants illuminate the composers’ fates from their perspective and establish both cultural references as well as the historical and political context.",

Traveling from the streets of Havana to the stage of Carnegie Hall, this revelatory documentary captures a forgotten generation of Cuba’s brightest musical talents as they enjoy an unexpected encounter with world fame. The veteran vocalists and instrumentalists collaborated with American guitarist and roots-music champion Ry Cooder to form the Buena Vista Social club, playing a jazz-inflected mix of cha-cha, mambo, bolero, and other traditional Latin American styles, and recording an album that won a Grammy and made them an international phenomenon. In the wake of this success, director Wim Wenders filmed the ensembles’ members-including golden-voiced Ibrahim Ferrer and piano virtuoso Rubén Gonzalez-in a series of illuminating interviews and live performances. The result is one of the most belove documentaries of the 1990’s, and an infectious ode to a neglected corner of Cuba’s prerevolutionary heritage."
